# Pico8-Autobuild

These scripts are examples of how you can automate the exporting of pico8 builds.
They mostly contain ways of changing the html export to make you're game's page look better.
You can however add to the build batch file to minify your code, preprocess you pico8 file for potentially different versions, or other action you wouldn't want to repeat over and over after every small change to the code.
The advanced example export can be previewed [here](https://werxzy.itch.io/1k-car).

Most of my recent game use scripts like these to create builds. https://werxzy.itch.io/

Feel free to submit your own ideas to make these examples better.
